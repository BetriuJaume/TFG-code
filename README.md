# TFG-code
Python code for the final project of the mathematics degree. This repository consists of two colab files that contain all the code for the project. I recommend strongly to run the code using the Colab environment, but there is a requirements.txt file in case you want to run it locally. To do so, follow the steps:
* Create a virtual environment: 
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/name_of_environment
```
* Activate the environment:
```bash
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
```
* Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
